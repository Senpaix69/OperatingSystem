The pthread_join() function waits for the thread specified by
thread to terminate. If that thread has already terminated,
then pthread_join() returns immediately. The thread
specified by thread must be joinable.
If retval is not NULL, then pthread_join() copies the exit
status of the target thread (i.e., the value that the target
thread supplied to pthread_exit(3)) into the location pointed
to by retval. If the target thread was canceled, then
PTHREAD_CANCELED is placed in the location pointed to by retval.
On success, pthread_join() returns 0; on error, it returns an
error number.University of Central Punjab

Threads
Example: Pthread Creation and Termination
This simple example code creates 5 threads with the
pthread_create() routine. Each thread prints a "Hello World!"
message, and then terminates with a call to pthread_exit().
