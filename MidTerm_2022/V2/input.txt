Keener political awareness in the 18th century,
the age of Enlightenment, made the essay an all-important vehicle 
for the criticism of society and religion. 
Because of its flexibility, its brevity, 
and its potential both for ambiguity and for 
allusions to current events and conditions, 
it was an ideal tool for philosophical reformers.
The Federalist Papers in America and the tracts of the French Revolutionaries
are among the countless examples of attempts during this 
period to improve the human condition through the essay.
